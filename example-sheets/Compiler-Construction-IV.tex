\begin{enumerate}
  \item This question is about function inlining. It is a common optimisation
    and most \textsc{C} implementations have directives for it. How can it
    adversely affect computation time? What sort of functions would be ideal
    candidates for inlining? (\emph{Hint}: remember computer design lectures)

  \item What is the scope of peephole optimisations? What are the other class
    of optimisations and rank them in difficulty with brief justification to
    your ranking. Give five examples of peephole optimisations.

  \item From \citet[chap. 13]{mogensen}, solve Exercise 13.2.

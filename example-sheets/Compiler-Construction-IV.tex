\begin{enumerate}
  \item This question is about function inlining. It is a common optimisation
    and most \textsc{C} implementations have directives for it. How can it
    adversely affect computation time? What sort of functions would be ideal
    candidates for inlining? (\emph{Hint}: remember computer design lectures)

  \item What is the scope of peephole optimisations? What are the other class
    of optimisations and rank them in difficulty with brief justification to
    your ranking. Give five examples of peephole optimisations.

  \item In \textsc{C}, when you are allocating memory with \texttt{malloc} you
    need to pass the size of the memory you want to be allocated and the
    routine returns a pointer. When you later want to free this memory you use
    the free routine and only pass the pointer. How come \emph{libc} knows how
    much memory to deallocate?

  \item After reviewing lecture notes on garbage collection, read
    \citet{unified} up to and including section 4.

  \item Cycles in reference counting is a well-known problem. Briefly explain
    the problem. Suggest a way to solve it without completely changing to a
    different garbage collection algorithm.

  \item From \citet[chap. 13]{mogensen}, solve Exercise 13.2.

## Exam safety tips

If the examiner decides to be mean, he will make you derive a rule for the `FOR`
loop or some other looping language construct. `FOR` loop was lecutred in the
previous iteration of the course, e.g.
[2015/2016](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1516/HLog+ModC/materials.html), so
I suggest you look through the relevant slides of that year. Another looping
construct `REPEAT` is covered in the exercises, I suggest you go through that
during your revision.

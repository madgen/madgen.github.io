\begin{enumerate}
  \item What is the difference between a register machine and a stack machine
    as used in programming language runtimes. In your discussion include at
    least, code density, performance, memory allocation, and implementation
    complexity.

  \item How is environment implemented in Slang interpreters 0 and 2. Pay
    special attention to handling of functions.

  \item What is the main difference between interpreter 0 and interpreter 2?
    What are the purposes of this change? What are the additions to interpreter
    2 in the version 3 and how do they improve the compiler?

  \item As you know Java virtual machine is a bytecode interpreter. Here are
    the instructions of a function \texttt{f}. What is the high-level code that
    produces these instructions? Annotate fragments of the code. This will
    require you to lookup what these instructions do online. Please do not use
    a decompiler.

    \begin{minted}{text}
public static int f(int);
Code:
   0: iload_0
   1: ifne          6
   4: iconst_1
   5: ireturn
   6: iload_0
   7: iload_0
   8: iconst_1
   9: isub
  10: invokestatic  #4     // Method f
  13: imul
  14: ireturn
    \end{minted}

<h1>Reflections on Cambridge Supervisions</h1>


<p class="in-which">In which I discuss my experiences with the unique teaching carried out in Oxbridge both as a supervisee and as a supervisor.</p>


<div class="post"><p>I reached one of the most bittersweet milestone of my life. It seems I’m done with Cambridge supervisions. By my calculations, I’ve been a supervisee for 150 hours and a supervisor for about 300. While my thoughts and feelings are fresh, I want to discuss Cambridge supervision experiences. Although this post is mostly about documenting and interpreting my experiences, I hope it will benefit supervisees and supervisors alike.</p>
<h2 id="rules-of-the-game">Rules of the game</h2>
<p>So what is a Oxbridge supervision anyway? It is the primary teaching method employed in Cambridge and Oxford universities. In Oxford, it goes by the name of tutorial. In Cambridge, they take place in two-to-one setting. There is one supervisor for every supervisee. In Oxford, they’re one-to-one. Nearly all work done in the course is handled by supervisors as opposed to lecturers. In principle, supervisions are meant to supplement lectures.</p>
<p>The number of supervisions and the number of supervisors vary from subject to subject, from term to term, and college to college. For computer science, it is usually three to four hours per week and due to the early specialisation of the discipline, there are a multitude of supervisors. In other subjects, it is more common to have the same person as a supervisors every week for a year or more.</p>
<p>Although supervision work is the largest bulk of the work done by a student throughout their degree, it is not graded. It is submitted 24 to 48 hours in advance to the supervisor, who gives feedback on the work without assigning a grade to it. The quality of a term’s work is delivered to the person responsible for the student (director of studies) at the end of the term using an online form. Although there is a predicated grade-based on performance, it is not used as a formal mean of assessment.</p>

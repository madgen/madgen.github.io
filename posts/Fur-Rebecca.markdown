### 23th of January, 2022

  - I imagine if you read Homer's _Odyssey_, you hated it as much as I loved it.
    I won't make the case for it as Margaret Atwood ruined it for me too in her
    novella [_The Penelopiad_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Penelopiad).
    She retells the famous story from the perspective of Odysseus' wife pointing
    out the gross injustices with a whimsical language. I bet you'd enjoy it as
    much as I did. Her voice reminded me of you.

### 16th of July, 2021

Not all interludes last five minutes.

  - _La Tortue Rouge_ (2021). It is poetry but in the form of animation. It
    would appeal to you.

### 29th of July, 2019

  - [_Gin, Sex, Malaria, and the Hunt for Academic
    Prestige_](https://www.chronicle.com/interactives/20190724-king-mead?utm_source=at&utm_medium=en&cid=at&fbclid=IwAR2HjTg3nc1J0J6a1n_snTYc8LUmO0hT4Ke6WUCLo0XAe0TU78zcu6s-mgg)
    by Charles King. Not the greatest piece of writing or the content, but some
    interesting insights about our nature and our surroundings.

### 10th of July, 2019

I apologise for the morbidity and the repetition in advance,

  - Soon after we met, I finished Borges' stories and essays. Then came a
    one-page parable called _The Witness_. That along with our conversation
    triggered a number of thoughts, connections, and (re)recommendations.

    The parable is about death and precisely the death of events and ideas that
    are witnessed by the recently deceased. I was astonished how close that was
    to what we talked about, people living as an image in others' minds and how
    true death follows long after that of the body.
  - Borges does not take it as far as I did though, his parable kills things
    with the last person who witnessed them directly while I allow them to get
    evolved, deformed, and passed through generations and distances far from
    their originator.

    I'd like to think that my mind went further than that of Borges, but the
    truth is it didn't. The idea is mainly derived from _I Am A Strange Loop_ by
    Douglas Hofstadter. This is the book that made me stop eat meat. He is
    mathematically minded, but also emotionally elevated like Borges. The second
    chapter is titled _On Souls and Their Sizes_, which starts with the section
    _Soul-Shards_. You know I like analogies but the concept of a soul-shard is
    etched into my brain the moment I laid eyes on it. The chapter talks about
    his relationship with his wife who passed away and how an unfaithful copy of
    her (shards of her soul) lives in him and influences his actions, so in a
    way she keeps living.  He admits the probability of a grieving man coming up
    with a theory of consciousness that gives him some solace, but I buy it.

  - This brings me to the final scene of _The Sheltering Sky_ (and the ending of
    the book of the same title which I have not read) directed by Bernardo
    Bertolucci. An old man says the following passage:

    > Because we don't know when we will die, we get to think of life as an
    > inexhaustible well. Yet everything happens only a certain number of times,
    > and a very small number really. How many more times will you remember a
    > certain afternoon of your childhood, some afternoon that is so deeply a
    > part of your being that you can't even conceive of your life without it?
    > Perhaps four or five times more, perhaps not even that. How many more
    > times will you watch the full moon rise? Perhaps twenty. And yet it all
    > seems limitless.

    I feel the urge to recite this passage in my head from time to time. I
    haven't always behaved this way and that's a loss, but for some time now
    (even before I knew you) I've been making mental notes of things that
    matters. That is why I waited for your bus to leave at Parker's Piece and
    watched you quietly. It's also why on that special Saturday as I looked at
    you, you had all my attention, all my mental might trying to save every
    second of the day, especially when you were quietly immersed into my
    friend's music. All so that I can remember it faithfully for finite number
    of times.

  - Ryuichi Sakamato who scored the soundtracks for _The Sheltering Sky_ was
    similarly moved by that passage. That's why many years after scoring the
    movie, he recorded _fullmoon_ which has the passage read in many languages.
    He overlays these recordings with ambient music in the background to create
    a touching piece.

  - He discusses this and his general approach to music in the documentary
    _Ryuichi Sakamoto: Coda_. He has a kind soul and the documentary is one of
    the best I've ever seen. Mainly because I believe in the honesty of what is
    on the screen. It shows him deal with cancer and his spiritual devotion to
    his work. It tells the story of the damaged piano rescued from the tsunami
    in Japan and the concert he gave with it and why. It is a worthy portrait to
    see.

    In a way, he is similar to _Hayao Miyazaki_. Maybe there is something unique
    in Japan's culture that bestows kind people with a wisdom that is not
    paralleled elsewhere in the world. Maybe I'll have to learn to be kinder and
    go there to see for myself.

  That's all for now. Lights are out, music is over.

  PS. I decided to curb my wings further and actively avoid looking at the
  analytics for this page. I don't want you changing your habits because I might
  see it.

### 5th of July, 2019

  - _Cardinals_, _Hair_, _The Knowledge_, _Later_ and _I Walk Away_ by
    Lele Marchitelli. Apparently, she is the new go-to person of _Paolo
    Sorrentino_, the director of two of my favourite films, _La Grande Bellezza_
    and _Youth_.

  - The first four of those songs are from the soundtrack album of _The Young
    Pope_. I've only seen the first episode, but so far it is everything we
    would like. It is stylish, decadent, and clever both in writing, acting, and
    cinematography.

### 3rd of July, 2019

  - _La Joya_ and _Reframe_ by Aukai. The whole album, _Reminiscence_, is nice
    and mellow like a summer day spent on a hammock with the exception of
    _Reframe_. That sounds more like a love affair.
  - There is a small village in Turkey where a [whistled
    language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistled_language) is, well,
    whistled. The village is named Kuşköy which literally means the village of
    birds. Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQmF7kbOrmE)
    explaining the whole affair. It is very unreasonable of me, but I want to go
    and learn their dialect.

    Where I stand, it sounds like a thinning of spoken languages and I find it
    fitting that it is more musical. Songs too communicate way more than their
    lyrics alone, don't they? So maybe if we thin the whistled language further,
    we may communicate with silence.
  - Also if you look at the entry for [17th of February,
    2019](#th-of-february-2019-3), you will see my recommendation for
    [_Paterson_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8pGJBgiiDU), the movie I
    mentioned about the bus driver poet.

### 29th of June, 2019

  - It was nice running into you today.
  - _The Cell_ by David Allred. It is contemporary folk apparently.

### 21st of June, 2019

  - _Spanish Caravan_ by The Doors.

    _Carry me Caraban take me away~~ Take me to
    Portugal, take me to Spain~~ Andalusia with fields full of grain~~ I have to
    see you again and again~~_

  - I'm off to Phoenix and then to LA, so no posts until next week. Enjoy the
    sun for me, would you?

### 19th of June, 2019

  - On multiple occasions, you asked me if I resented you. You were so far off
    the mark every time. However, about five or six months ago I did come close.

    I was idly browsing titles in Waterstones and in a stroke of luck, _A Room
    of One's Own_ caught my eye. I thought what a funny curious title it had. At
    that point, I was still of the opinion that Virginia Woolf owes her fame to
    being a feminist. How wrong I was. I don't think I know anyone whose use of
    language and conviction are as captivating. Thinking that it was possible
    (even probable) that I would have ignored her for the rest of my life out of
    ignorance is terrifying. What a waste it would have been.

    The reason I almost resented you is, out of everyone I know, you were the
    person who should have picked up a copy of the book, smack me in the head
    with it, and tell me to read it. I'd have read it and I'd have been
    grateful. Having known you, my introduction to Woolf shouldn't have been by
    chance (though I'm sure subconsciously you're partly the reason I bought _A
    Room of One's Own_ that day).

    When you told me you were going to teach and that you are sick of being
    poor, six months ago I would have objected vehemently (not that you should
    care) from the top of my high horse. However, as I read your message the
    first thing that appeared in my mind was that everyone needs a room of their
    own and £500 a year (adjusted for inflation since Woolf's time). My opinion
    now (in part thanks to Woolf) is that maybe once you can breathe freely, you
    can make your voice heard louder. Maybe that is all you need.

    This brings me to the other title I finished reading last week, _The Death
    of the Moth and Other Essays_. I'm weary of suggesting you a Woolf title, of
    course. It's dangerously close to mansplaining, but it seems this collection
    of essays is seldom found in bookshops and discussed even less. They have
    been posthumously published by her husband.

    Half the essays are about great men of letters. I don't think you'd like
    those. They wouldn't bring tears to your eyes as reading Schopenhauer once
    did, but I don't see you taking joy in reading them either. The other essays
    are, however, way more fascinating. In particular, the titular essay _The
    Death of the Moth_ is maybe the peak of modernism. She writes about the last
    hours of a moth that she watched as it tried to escape through the window,
    but couldn't due to the glass blocking the way. In a subject seemingly dull,
    she fully describes life with eloquence. Joyce's quote "in the particular
    lies the universal" fully captures this essay. A close second in the
    collection is _Street Haunting_ which describes her wandering in the streets
    of London at night.  It is a wonderful journey and I think it will speak to
    you. It is the kind of wondering that would render you joyous.  Then there
    is _Middlebrow_ and _Professions for Women_, in which fire comes out of
    pages unapologetically. I don't think the latter essay will be useful to you
    because you have already killed your angel, but it is still enjoyable to
    read her go at it. Finally, there are _Why?_, _Craftsmanship_ and _A Letter
    to a Young Poet_. As I'm sure you can tell, these are all about writing and
    language. They may or may not have utility for you, I can't judge. However,
    I do think you'd enjoy reading them regardless just as I enjoy reading a
    well-written essay on mathematics even when the content is second nature.

  - On other news, my move is now complete. The room speaks to me. As if all
    these years it was calling for me. Now with my arrival, I feel the space
    around me is in unison with my actions. The perfect place to write a book,
    which is fortunate because that is my task for the next three months.

### 16th of June, 2019

  - _Ballata dell'amore cieco_ by Fabrizio de André
  - Good luck with the move this week. You helping me with my last move was pure
    and very kind. I appreciate it. I hope everything goes smoothly.

### 14th of June, 2019

  - _Plaisirs d'amour_ by René Aubry. That's the album we listened to in that
    bay I sent you the photos of. What is not captured in pictures can be heard
    in the melody. Maybe start with _Salento_, _Scirocco_, and _Sirtaki à
    Helsinki_.

### 2nd of June, 2019

  - I don't know if you have any idea why I maintain this page. I personally
    have eight reasons on odd days and more on even days and today is an even
    day. I'll give you one.

    If I were a fire, the entries on this page would be the little cracking bits
    that leave the main body of the fire. Not because they want to, but because
    they have to. They are the bits that could not be contained. But a little
    cracking bit of the fire is not the fire, merely a fraction of a
    fraction of a fraction.

    The reason I'm telling this right now is I won't have an Internet connection
    next week. I'll be up in the mountains and down by the bays and back up
    again, walking. An eroding unfaithful copy of your self that is in my mind
    will be there too (without the hassle of walking of course). Without a
    doubt, I'll see a bird, or a rock, or the glorious sea curving just right.
    It too will be a little bit of fire that I'd like you to feel, but I can't
    make you feel. If I could share them, I would, but you can't truly share a
    moment in a different moment, can you?

    What I'm trying to say is I wish you could see through my eyes and think my
    thoughts.

  - _Daydream_ by Wallace Collection

### 1st of June, 2019

  - _Edvard Munch: love and angst_ exhibition in British Museum. I attempted
    writing this entry and failed. I find it surprisingly difficult to be honest
    and if I'm not being honest, what's the point?

    I desperately want to say I understand how Munch feels and that his soul
    through his work resonates with me. I look at the other museum visitors as
    if they are not worthy of enjoying the same artwork I'm looking at, the way
    someone like Holden Caulfield would do. Then again who am I to understand
    Munch? I haven't lost my mother at two or my sister at thirteen. Their
    memory hasn't haunted me for years to come. Yet it connects with me when
    he says "sickness, insanity and death were the angels that surrounded my
    cradle and they have followed me throughout my life."

    I also know the feeling of a lover facing away from me as her hair extends
    to my heart (_Separation II_). I know the fusion and the intensity of _The
    Kiss_. I also saw brilliance through darkness as he did when he painted Eva
    Mudocci in _The Brooch_. If you just look at the corner of her mouth, you
    can see how much he loved her.

    I'm sure you'll enjoy it for entirely different set of reasons. Perhaps for
    his poetry that binds all his works or the intensity eminating from his
    female figures. In any case, it's worth your time.

### 27th of May, 2019

  - _La Double Vie de Véronique_ by Krzysztof Kieślowski. There are no shortage
    of reasons why you'd like this movie, but its poetry and the scene she sings
    _Van den Budenmayer: Concerto en mi mineur_ by Zbigniew Preisner should be
    enough on their own.

### 24th of May, 2019

  - Beggarstaffs exhibition at Fitzwilliam. It is worth going for their earlier
    works alone. They are effortless and timeless. The later works involving
    architecture are also pleasing. Structures can be more expressive than
    us mortals.

### Always

  - I love you and I miss you.

### 18th of May, 2019

 - _Motion_ by Rone

### 14th of May, 2019

### 10th of May, 2019

  - _Otto_ by Woodkid
  - _Einstein On the Beach: Knee Play 5_ by The Philip Glass Ensemble.
    Here's weird for you. This is from the only opera I want to see.

### 8th of May, 2019

  - I saw _Cloud Atlas_ maybe four times (twice in the cinema for good measure)
    and I love the story---how can I not? It's so intertwined and it features
    Cambridge.  Moreover, it has one of the gentlest scores I know of. I'm fond
    of _Cloud Atlas Opening Title_, _Travel to Edinburgh_, _Kesselring_, and
    _Cloud Atlas End Title_ in particular. I wonder if it is obvious to you
    which of those appeals to me the most.

### 6th of May, 2019

  - _Sunny_ by Bobby Hebb

    I wanted today to do justice to the song, but to no avail. My celestial
    powers fell short. Luckily, you don't lack imagination, so perhaps picture
    yourself in a serene summer's day either chilling under the shade of a tree
    or having a coffee in a little Italian town.

    I think a good birthday message is less about the wishes and more about
    celebrating the highlights of your past age. For me, this makes finding the
    source material a rather difficult task, so I'll keep it short. It puts my
    _heart_ at ease to know that you have achieved, in your words, a happy
    ending.  My wish is that it trancends to a happy being.

### 4th of May, 2019

  - I think I favour Nina Simone's _Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood_ over
    _Feeling Good_.

### 29th of April, 2019

  - Machin Feast at Queens' on 10th of May. The deadline for applications is
    tomorrow 10pm. I hear there is good company.

### 28th of April, 2019

  - _A Dream within a Dream_ by Oren Lavie. Have a peaceful Sunday darling.

### 27th of April, 2019

  - [_How Anna Delvey tricked New
    York_](https://www.thecut.com/2018/05/how-anna-delvey-tricked-new-york.html)
    by Jessica Pressler. The writing is mediocre at best, but the story is
    silver and it is shined by its reality. It would be a delight if you lended
    your voice to a fictional Anna Delvey.
  - The natural follow up recommendation would be my favourite film in the whole
    world. I've already told you about it in person and you weren't terribly
    interested, so maybe I should spare you. In any case, although you didn't
    realise it at the time, my sharing of that film with anyone is deeply
    personal. I wouldn't write it down anywhere---I realise as I write that,
    this is the polar opposite of what you'd do.

### 20th of April, 2019

  - _Microhabitat_ directed by Jeon Go-Woon. It's an honest story. The
    protagonist presents an ideal without glorifying the cost of being true to
    yourself. She, dare I say it, reminds me of who you could be. If you watch
    the trailer, I promise the film offers more than that.

PS. Do you like the commentary that goes with the recommendations?

### 14th of April, 2019

  - [_Can't Stop Running_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjhZhI2Zthg) by Adam
    Ben Ezra. I love this one. You'll love this one.

### 11th of April, 2019

  - _Asturias_ by [Isaac Albeniz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEfFbuT3I6A).
    I'm sure you listened to it many times before, but I just realised how much
    the player influences the emotional outcome. Here's the father of classical
    guitar [Andres Segovia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCeebWgjrrU) playing
    it.  He lacks Albeniz's vigour but adds tranquility. Then there is [Ana
    Vidovic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inBKFMB-yPg) not so much playing
    distinct notes, but gliding from one to another.
  - _The Song of the Golden Dragon_ by Estas Tonne. A piece not to enjoy but to
    be overwhelmed.
  - _Celestial Intoxication_ by Shpongle. Maybe not the most skilfull, but to me
    the most interesting one. It covers the largest emotional ground. I'm sure
    you know when to listen to this one.

### 5th of April, 2019

  - _Caprice_ by Worakls. Not your genre, but it fits the first week of April
    rather well.

    Like Thylacine, Worakls too names songs after places. I like the idea. I
    want to hear a good _Istanbul_ and a _Marrakech_. It might take a while.

### 31st of March, 2019

  - _The Fall_ directed by Tarsem Singh. I don't know how it hasn't occurred to
    me to suggest it to you until now. It's dramatic just in the way you'd like
    and its visual aesthetic is just the way I like.

    The trailer on Youtube reveals too much though. So may be take a leap of
    faith?
  - _Black Sands_ by Bonobo
  - _Champion Sound_ by Crystal Fighters. This one is when you're in a good
    mood. It'll boost it, I promise. The whole album is interesting, the lyrics
    are not always uplifting, but the melodies are.

### 26th of March, 2019

  - _Zima Blue_ is the 9th episode of the short animation anthology on Netflix.
    It's based on a short story written by Alastair Reynolds. I like the message
    of course, but I think you'd enjoy the narration more.

    A less pronounced message is that our reasoning and perception are noisy and
    often far from the reality. You can relate to that, can't you?
  - _Ayayay_ by Tony Tonite
  - I found the perfect song to suggest to you on your birthday.

PS. Honestly, I have a lot to say about your recent story, but not here. At
least, I can say that I read it all with a genuine smile on my face.

### 24th of March, 2019

  - _Aurora_ by Zero 7
  - _Curls_ and _Petals_ by Bibio

### 15th of March, 2019

  - They don't know what I know.

  ![](/images/new-woolf.jpeg)

### 6th of March, 2019

  - I can hear the music today. It's so gloomy outside, yet everything I see
    shines a bit brighter.

    I can't believe I haven't recommended you any Four Tet songs so far. Maybe
    because I thought you'd find them _too_ electronic.  The problem with not
    seeing someone for a long time is that you start losing the provenance of
    impressions, which is the best bit of knowing anyone or anything, don't you
    think?

    Anyway, here are three: She Moves She, Locked, and Two Thousand and
    Seventeen. If I were to see these as an envelope produced by a single
    synthesiser and not as individual songs (and in a sense that is the case),
    they'd correspond to _attack_, _sustain_, and _release_. They work well in
    that order. It should really have _decay_ between attack and sustain, but we
    have too much of that elsewhere.

### 29th of February, 2019

  - Le Roi et l'Oiseau (1980) directed by Paul Grimault. This is an animated
    movie that took more than 20 years to complete for various reasons. It is
    done in collaboration with the poet Jacques Prévert. More than a dozen
    times, the movie manages to invoke the sublime through its artwork. The
    interactions between its bizarre characters are captivating despite the
    simplicity of the plot. To me, it is one of the more tasteful surrealist
    works of cinema.

### 26th of February, 2019
  - It's another sunny day and that calls for another song from the past.
    California Dreamin' by The Mamas & The Papas.

### 25th of February, 2019
  - Aquarius (Let the Sunshine in) by the 5th Dimension and Her Morning Elegance
    by Oren Lavie. I know you know them both, but they fit the day and you so
    well, wouldn't you say?
  - Enjoy the sunshine.

### 17th of February, 2019
  - You mentioning poetry reminded me of
    [Paterson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8pGJBgiiDU) (2016) by Jim
    Jarmusch. It is a slow-burning film about a poet. I told you this before, I
    cannot feel poetry unless it is in Turkish. Some recitations in this movie
    are exceptions to that. Jarmusch is also the director of Only Lovers Left
    Alive, Dead Man, and Coffee & Cigarettes (more like the last short film that
    we liked and less like the others). Hopefully, that gives you an idea.
  - What I said about not talking about our lives is a good principle, but when
    you _need_ me to be there for you, just tell me and I'll listen.
  - It felt good.

### 13th of February, 2019

  - Before You ~~Love~~ Leave by Frenic, so that you can dance on your own.
  - Summon the Fire by The Comet is Coming. Just some good modern Jazz.
  - Finally, there's a song by a good friend of mine. It has no lyrics, but the
    journey it takes you could not have been clearer if it was spelled out. I'd
    have liked you to listen to it, but I don't know how.

### 3rd of February, 2019

  - Travel Alone by Dr. DAD. Not only it puts me at ease as I'm listening to it
    right now but also, just a moment ago, as I was still listening to it, I
    created something elegant. If I'm right, its effects will echo way beyond my
    PhD. From now on, at least in my mind and completely incidentally,
    everything that follows from it is going to be linked to this song.
  - [To Save the Sound of a Stradivarius, a Whole City Must Keep
    Quiet](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/arts/music/stradivarius-sound-bank-recording-cremona.html)
    by Max Paradiso. The decadence in this story is going to make you a bit
    uncomfortable, but it'd be difficult for you not to like it deep down.

### 19th of January, 2019

  - There is a new album of Thylacine called ROADS, Vol. 1. In nature, when a
    force is acted upon a body at its natural frequency, the body resonates with
    greater intensity. This describes nicely how this album makes me feel. You
    can start with El Alba.

### 15th of January, 2019

  - Persona (1966) by Ingmar Bergman. There is no doubt, you'll love this film.
    They are showing it in the Picturehouse on Thursday. I know you're not
    reading this, but I wish you did and... You should give him a go some time.
  - Winter Sleep by Bongbeck. As it happens, Winter Sleep is also the name of my
    favourite Nuri Bilge Ceylan film.
  - Maa'asalama by Traumer

### 21st of December, 2018

  - We're sufficiently close to the end of the year that I can announce Kingdoms
    in Colour by Maribou State as the best album of the year. You can start with
    Feel Good, then Kama, followed by Part Time Glory, but you should really
    listen to the whole thing. It's a real treat.
  - Just in case you're craving some electronic jazz blend, you can try Amateur
    Girlfriends Go Proskirt Agents by Xploding Plastix. I swear I haven't
    noticed the ridiculous album and band names until now. Within the album
    Sports, Not Heavy Crime would be a good start.
  - Also, I trust you're in warm company that pierces through the cold and dark
    days we are going through. Do enjoy the festive season.

  - Bertolucci died two weeks after I recommended you the Sheltering Sky. Call
    me superstitious, but I'm sceptical about recommending you another one now.
    Yet, here I go. The Great Pear Tree by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. It's about a fresh
    university graduand trying to publish his first book. He's trapped by
    worldly problems such as family and money. He's not exactly what you'd call
    a protagonist and his concerns are different to yours when it comes to
    writing. I still think you'd find it insightful.

    Its director is my favourite Turkish one alive. His movies are beautiful and
    capture the Turkish human condition without any pretence. Maybe give it a
    try. I hesitate recommending him to anyone because his movies are
    slow-burning and long. I regret doing that with you. So here it is.

    I'm horrible at being subtle, ain't I? This is the third movie about a
    writer I recommended to you. Allow me to be more direct, I hope you're
    writing every day and I hope people get to hear your voice some day. It'd be
    a great crime otherwise.
  - Suspiria (2018) by Luca Guadagnino. This is the guy who directed Call Me by
    Your Name last year. It was beautiful and very unexpectedly turned into a
    great feminist statement. I know you can't stand gore, but if you can
    stomach it for once, let it be for Suspiria. If this is not enough of a
    pitch, Tilda Swinton is in it and she reigns supreme as she always does.
    It's screening at the Picturehouse right now and the big screen only renders
    it more beautiful.

    In case you decide, you can't (won't) stomach it, then at least watch the
    predecessor to Call Me by Your Name, I am Love. Swinton is leading and
    you'll identify with her character perfectly.
  - I don't think you'd like Haruki Murakami. He's focused too much on unpacking
    the individual and deals with solitude and isolation and alienation like
    Kafka but with a different tone. But there is one undeniable benefit of
    reading him and that is his past self. He ran a Jazz bar in Tokyo for many
    years you see. So he sprinkles his pages with great Jazz albums, real
    treats. One such album is Curtis Fuller's Blues-Ette, in particular Five
    Spot After Dark.

  - The Sheltering Sky directed by Bernardo Bertolucci.

    Cinematographically, it may be one of the most pleasing films I've ever
    seen.  I think you'd enjoy the serenity of Africa as much as I did. Yet, way
    more than the images, you'll enjoy the characters (played by Debra Winger
    and John Malkovich) and their rather impossible situation. It is the kind of
    film that makes you read the book. It also has one of my favourite passages
    in a film; I'm sure you can figure out which. If this is not good enough
    sales pitch, its soundtrack is composed by Ryuichi Sakamato and the
    corresponding soundtrack album is a masterpiece on its own right.
  - Becoming by Mammal Hands
  - Vous Dansez by KZA

### 6th of November, 2018

- Twenty-Four Hours in the Life of a Woman by Stefan Zweig. I don't remember any
  other story I've read with more vivid imagery.

### 29th of October, 2018

- Yazz Ahmed concert in Cambridge Jazz Festival on the 18th of November
- Klimt/Schiele exhibition in Royal Academy or Arts from November 4th
- Thylacine's new single called "The Road"
- "Stranger than Fiction" is a precursor to "Dans la Maison". It is magical
  realism which is not your cup of tea, I know, but still worth seeing.

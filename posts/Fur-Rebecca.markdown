### 6th of November, 2018

- Twenty-Four Hours in the Life of a Woman by Stefan Zweig. I don't remember any
  other story I've read with more vivid imagery.

### 29th of October, 2018

- Yazz Ahmed concert in Cambridge Jazz Festival on the 18th of November
- Klimt/Schiele exhibition in Royal Academy or Arts from November 4th
- Thylacine's new single called "The Road"
- "Stranger than Fiction" is a precursor to "Dans la Maison". It is magical
  realism which is not your cup of tea, I know, but still worth seeing.

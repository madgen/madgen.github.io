### 14th of November, 2018

  - The Sheltering Sky directed by Bernardo Bertolucci.

    Cinematographically, it may be one of the most pleasing films I've ever
    seen.  I think you'd enjoy the serenity of Africa as much as I did. Yet, way
    more than the images, you'll enjoy the characters (played by Debra Winger
    and John Malkovich) and their rather impossible situation. It is the kind of
    film that makes you read the book. It also has one of my favourite passages
    in a film; I'm sure you can figure out which. If this is not good enough
    sales pitch, its soundtrack is composed by Ryuichi Sakamato and the
    corresponding soundtrack album is a masterpiece on its own right.
  - Becoming by Mammal Hands
  - Vous Dansez by KZA

### 6th of November, 2018

- Twenty-Four Hours in the Life of a Woman by Stefan Zweig. I don't remember any
  other story I've read with more vivid imagery.

### 29th of October, 2018

- Yazz Ahmed concert in Cambridge Jazz Festival on the 18th of November
- Klimt/Schiele exhibition in Royal Academy or Arts from November 4th
- Thylacine's new single called "The Road"
- "Stranger than Fiction" is a precursor to "Dans la Maison". It is magical
  realism which is not your cup of tea, I know, but still worth seeing.

### 3rd of February, 2019

  - Travel Alone by Dr. DAD. Not only it puts me at ease as I'm listening to it
    right now but also, just a moment ago, as I was still listening to it, I
    created something elegant. If I'm right, its effects will echo way beyond my
    PhD. From now on, at least in my mind and completely incidentally,
    everything that follows from it is going to be linked to this song.

### 19th of January, 2019

  - There is a new album of Thylacine called ROADS, Vol. 1. In nature, when a
    force is acted upon a body at its natural frequency, the body resonates with
    greater intensity. This describes nicely how this album makes me feel. You
    can start with El Alba.

### 15th of January, 2019

  - Persona (1966) by Ingmar Bergman. There is no doubt, you'll love this film.
    They are showing it in the Picturehouse on Thursday. I know you're not
    reading this, but I wish you did and... You should give him a go some time.
  - Winter Sleep by Bongbeck. As it happens, Winter Sleep is also the name of my
    favourite Nuri Bilge Ceylan film.
  - Maa'asalama by Traumer

### 21st of December, 2018

  - We're sufficiently close to the end of the year that I can announce Kingdoms
    in Colour by Maribou State as the best album of the year. You can start with
    Feel Good, then Kama, followed by Part Time Glory, but you should really
    listen to the whole thing. It's a real treat.
  - Just in case you're craving some electronic jazz blend, you can try Amateur
    Girlfriends Go Proskirt Agents by Xploding Plastix. I swear I haven't
    noticed the ridiculous album and band names until now. Within the album
    Sports, Not Heavy Crime would be a good start.
  - Also, I trust you're in warm company that pierces through the cold and dark
    days we are going through. Do enjoy the festive season.

### 3rd of December, 2018

  - Bertolucci died two weeks after I recommended you the Sheltering Sky. Call
    me superstitious, but I'm sceptical about recommending you another one now.
    Yet, here I go. The Great Pear Tree by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. It's about a fresh
    university graduand trying to publish his first book. He's trapped by
    worldly problems such as family and money. He's not exactly what you'd call
    a protagonist and his concerns are different to yours when it comes to
    writing. I still think you'd find it insightful.

    Its director is my favourite Turkish one alive. His movies are beautiful and
    capture the Turkish human condition without any pretence. Maybe give it a
    try. I hesitate recommending him to anyone because his movies are
    slow-burning and long. I regret doing that with you. So here it is.

    I'm horrible at being subtle, ain't I? This is the third movie about a
    writer I recommended to you. Allow me to be more direct, I hope you're
    writing every day and I hope people get to hear your voice some day. It'd be
    a great crime otherwise.
  - Suspiria (2018) by Luca Guadagnino. This is the guy who directed Call Me by
    Your Name last year. It was beautiful and very unexpectedly turned into a
    great feminist statement. I know you can't stand gore, but if you can
    stomach it for once, let it be for Suspiria. If this is not enough of a
    pitch, Tilda Swinton is in it and she reigns supreme as she always does.
    It's screening at the Picturehouse right now and the big screen only renders
    it more beautiful.

    In case you decide, you can't (won't) stomach it, then at least watch the
    predecessor to Call Me by Your Name, I am Love. Swinton is leading and
    you'll identify with her character perfectly.
  - I don't think you'd like Haruki Murakami. He's focused too much on unpacking
    the individual and deals with solitude and isolation and alienation like
    Kafka but with a different tone. But there is one undeniable benefit of
    reading him and that is his past self. He ran a Jazz bar in Tokyo for many
    years you see. So he sprinkles his pages with great Jazz albums, real
    treats. One such album is Curtis Fuller's Blues-Ette, in particular Five
    Spot After Dark.

### 14th of November, 2018

  - The Sheltering Sky directed by Bernardo Bertolucci.

    Cinematographically, it may be one of the most pleasing films I've ever
    seen.  I think you'd enjoy the serenity of Africa as much as I did. Yet, way
    more than the images, you'll enjoy the characters (played by Debra Winger
    and John Malkovich) and their rather impossible situation. It is the kind of
    film that makes you read the book. It also has one of my favourite passages
    in a film; I'm sure you can figure out which. If this is not good enough
    sales pitch, its soundtrack is composed by Ryuichi Sakamato and the
    corresponding soundtrack album is a masterpiece on its own right.
  - Becoming by Mammal Hands
  - Vous Dansez by KZA

### 6th of November, 2018

- Twenty-Four Hours in the Life of a Woman by Stefan Zweig. I don't remember any
  other story I've read with more vivid imagery.

### 29th of October, 2018

- Yazz Ahmed concert in Cambridge Jazz Festival on the 18th of November
- Klimt/Schiele exhibition in Royal Academy or Arts from November 4th
- Thylacine's new single called "The Road"
- "Stranger than Fiction" is a precursor to "Dans la Maison". It is magical
  realism which is not your cup of tea, I know, but still worth seeing.

### 31st of March, 2019

  - _The Fall_ directed by Tarsem Singh. I don't know how it hasn't occurred to
    me to suggest it to you until now. I think it is dramatic just in the way
    you'd like. The trailer on Youtube reveals too much though. So may be take a
    leap of faith with this one?
  - _Black Sands_ by Bonobo
  - _Champion Sound_ by Crystal Fighters. This one is when you're in a good
    mood. It'll boost it, I promise. The whole album is interesting, the lyrics
    are not always uplifting, but the melodies are.

### 26th of March, 2019

  - _Zima Blue_ is the 9th episode of the short animation anthology on Netflix.
    It's based on a short story written by Alastair Reynolds. I like the message
    of course, but I think you'd enjoy the narration more.

    A less pronounced message is that our reasoning and perception are noisy and
    often far from the reality. You can relate to that, can't you?
  - _Ayayay_ by Tony Tonite
  - I found the perfect song to suggest to you on your birthday.

PS. Honestly, I have a lot to say about your recent story, but not here. At
least, I can say that I read it all with a genuine smile on my face.

### 24th of March, 2019

  - _Aurora_ by Zero 7
  - _Curls_ and _Petals_ by Bibio

### 15th of March, 2019

  - They don't know what I know.

### 6th of March, 2019

  - I can hear the music today. It's so gloomy outside, yet everything I see
    shines a bit brighter.

    I can't believe I haven't recommended you any Four Tet songs so far. Maybe
    because I thought you'd find them _too_ electronic.  The problem with not
    seeing someone for a long time is that you start losing the provenance of
    impressions, which is the best bit of knowing anyone or anything, don't you
    think?

    Anyway, here are three: She Moves She, Locked, and Two Thousand and
    Seventeen. If I were to see these as an envelope produced by a single
    synthesiser and not as individual songs (and in a sense that is the case),
    they'd correspond to _attack_, _sustain_, and _release_. They work well in
    that order. It should really have _decay_ between attack and sustain, but we
    have too much of that elsewhere.

### 29th of February, 2019

  - Le Roi et l'Oiseau (1980) directed by Paul Grimault. This is an animated
    movie that took more than 20 years to complete for various reasons. It is
    done in collaboration with the poet Jacques Prévert. More than a dozen
    times, the movie manages to invoke the sublime through its artwork. The
    interactions between its bizarre characters are captivating despite the
    simplicity of the plot. To me, it is one of the more tasteful surrealist
    works of cinema.

### 26th of February, 2019
  - It's another sunny day and that calls for another song from the past.
    California Dreamin' by The Mamas & The Papas.

### 25th of February, 2019
  - Aquarius (Let the Sunshine in) by the 5th Dimension and Her Morning Elegance
    by Oren Lavie. I know you know them both, but they fit the day and you so
    well, wouldn't you say?
  - Enjoy the sunshine.

### 17th of February, 2019
  - You mentioning poetry reminded me of Paterson (2016) by Jim Jarmusch. It is
    a slow-burning film about a poet. I told you this before, I cannot feel
    poetry unless it is in Turkish. Some recitations in this movie are
    exceptions to that. Jarmusch is also the director of Only Lovers Left Alive,
    Dead Man, and Coffee & Cigarettes (more like the last short film that we
    liked and less like the others). Hopefully, that gives you an idea.
  - What I said about not talking about our lives is a good principle, but when
    you _need_ me to be there for you, just tell me and I'll listen.
  - It felt good.

### 13th of February, 2019

  - Before You ~~Love~~ Leave by Frenic, so that you can dance on your own.
  - Summon the Fire by The Comet is Coming. Just some good modern Jazz.
  - Finally, there's a song by a good friend of mine. It has no lyrics, but the
    journey it takes you could not have been clearer if it was spelled out. I'd
    have liked you to listen to it, but I don't know how.

### 3rd of February, 2019

  - Travel Alone by Dr. DAD. Not only it puts me at ease as I'm listening to it
    right now but also, just a moment ago, as I was still listening to it, I
    created something elegant. If I'm right, its effects will echo way beyond my
    PhD. From now on, at least in my mind and completely incidentally,
    everything that follows from it is going to be linked to this song.
  - [To Save the Sound of a Stradivarius, a Whole City Must Keep
    Quiet](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/arts/music/stradivarius-sound-bank-recording-cremona.html)
    by Max Paradiso. The decadence in this story is going to make you a bit
    uncomfortable, but it'd be difficult for you not to like it deep down.

### 19th of January, 2019

  - There is a new album of Thylacine called ROADS, Vol. 1. In nature, when a
    force is acted upon a body at its natural frequency, the body resonates with
    greater intensity. This describes nicely how this album makes me feel. You
    can start with El Alba.

### 15th of January, 2019

  - Persona (1966) by Ingmar Bergman. There is no doubt, you'll love this film.
    They are showing it in the Picturehouse on Thursday. I know you're not
    reading this, but I wish you did and... You should give him a go some time.
  - Winter Sleep by Bongbeck. As it happens, Winter Sleep is also the name of my
    favourite Nuri Bilge Ceylan film.
  - Maa'asalama by Traumer

### 21st of December, 2018

  - We're sufficiently close to the end of the year that I can announce Kingdoms
    in Colour by Maribou State as the best album of the year. You can start with
    Feel Good, then Kama, followed by Part Time Glory, but you should really
    listen to the whole thing. It's a real treat.
  - Just in case you're craving some electronic jazz blend, you can try Amateur
    Girlfriends Go Proskirt Agents by Xploding Plastix. I swear I haven't
    noticed the ridiculous album and band names until now. Within the album
    Sports, Not Heavy Crime would be a good start.
  - Also, I trust you're in warm company that pierces through the cold and dark
    days we are going through. Do enjoy the festive season.

### 3rd of December, 2018

  - Bertolucci died two weeks after I recommended you the Sheltering Sky. Call
    me superstitious, but I'm sceptical about recommending you another one now.
    Yet, here I go. The Great Pear Tree by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. It's about a fresh
    university graduand trying to publish his first book. He's trapped by
    worldly problems such as family and money. He's not exactly what you'd call
    a protagonist and his concerns are different to yours when it comes to
    writing. I still think you'd find it insightful.

    Its director is my favourite Turkish one alive. His movies are beautiful and
    capture the Turkish human condition without any pretence. Maybe give it a
    try. I hesitate recommending him to anyone because his movies are
    slow-burning and long. I regret doing that with you. So here it is.

    I'm horrible at being subtle, ain't I? This is the third movie about a
    writer I recommended to you. Allow me to be more direct, I hope you're
    writing every day and I hope people get to hear your voice some day. It'd be
    a great crime otherwise.
  - Suspiria (2018) by Luca Guadagnino. This is the guy who directed Call Me by
    Your Name last year. It was beautiful and very unexpectedly turned into a
    great feminist statement. I know you can't stand gore, but if you can
    stomach it for once, let it be for Suspiria. If this is not enough of a
    pitch, Tilda Swinton is in it and she reigns supreme as she always does.
    It's screening at the Picturehouse right now and the big screen only renders
    it more beautiful.

    In case you decide, you can't (won't) stomach it, then at least watch the
    predecessor to Call Me by Your Name, I am Love. Swinton is leading and
    you'll identify with her character perfectly.
  - I don't think you'd like Haruki Murakami. He's focused too much on unpacking
    the individual and deals with solitude and isolation and alienation like
    Kafka but with a different tone. But there is one undeniable benefit of
    reading him and that is his past self. He ran a Jazz bar in Tokyo for many
    years you see. So he sprinkles his pages with great Jazz albums, real
    treats. One such album is Curtis Fuller's Blues-Ette, in particular Five
    Spot After Dark.

### 14th of November, 2018

  - The Sheltering Sky directed by Bernardo Bertolucci.

    Cinematographically, it may be one of the most pleasing films I've ever
    seen.  I think you'd enjoy the serenity of Africa as much as I did. Yet, way
    more than the images, you'll enjoy the characters (played by Debra Winger
    and John Malkovich) and their rather impossible situation. It is the kind of
    film that makes you read the book. It also has one of my favourite passages
    in a film; I'm sure you can figure out which. If this is not good enough
    sales pitch, its soundtrack is composed by Ryuichi Sakamato and the
    corresponding soundtrack album is a masterpiece on its own right.
  - Becoming by Mammal Hands
  - Vous Dansez by KZA

### 6th of November, 2018

- Twenty-Four Hours in the Life of a Woman by Stefan Zweig. I don't remember any
  other story I've read with more vivid imagery.

### 29th of October, 2018

- Yazz Ahmed concert in Cambridge Jazz Festival on the 18th of November
- Klimt/Schiele exhibition in Royal Academy or Arts from November 4th
- Thylacine's new single called "The Road"
- "Stranger than Fiction" is a precursor to "Dans la Maison". It is magical
  realism which is not your cup of tea, I know, but still worth seeing.

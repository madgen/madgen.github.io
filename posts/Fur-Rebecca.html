<h1>Für Rebecca</h1>


<p class="in-which">In which I provide a not-so-awkward recommendation service for her.</p>


<div class="post"><h3 id="th-of-june-2019">16th of June, 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Ballata dell’amore cieco</em> by Fabrizio de André</li>
<li>Good luck with the move this week. You helping me with my last move was pure and very kind. I appreciate it. I hope everything goes smoothly.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="th-of-june-2019-1">14th of June, 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Plaisirs d’amour</em> by René Aubry. That’s the album we listened to in that bay I sent you the photos of. What is not captured in pictures can be heard in the melody. Maybe start with <em>Salento</em>, <em>Scirocco</em>, and <em>Sirtaki à Helsinki</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="nd-of-june-2019">2nd of June, 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>I don’t know if you have any idea why I maintain this page. I personally have eight reasons on odd days and more on even days and today is an even day. I’ll give you one.</p>
<p>If I were a fire, the entries on this page would be the little cracking bits that leave the main body of the fire. Not because they want to, but because they have to. They are the bits that could not be contained. But a little cracking bit of the fire is not the fire, merely a fraction of a fraction of a fraction.</p>
<p>The reason I’m telling this right now is I won’t have an Internet connection next week. I’ll be up in the mountains and down by the bays and back up again, walking. An eroding unfaithful copy of your self that is in my mind will be there too (without the hassle of walking of course). Without a doubt, I’ll see a bird, or a rock, or the glorious sea curving just right. It too will be a little bit of fire that I’d like you to feel, but I can’t make you feel. If I could share them, I would, but you can’t truly share a moment in a different moment, can you?</p>
<p>What I’m trying to say is I wish you could see through my eyes and think my thoughts.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Daydream</em> by Wallace Collection</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="st-of-june-2019">1st of June, 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Edvard Munch: love and angst</em> exhibition in British Museum. I attempted writing this entry and failed. I find it surprisingly difficult to be honest and if I’m not being honest, what’s the point?</p>
<p>I desperately want to say I understand how Munch feels and that his soul through his work resonates with me. I look at the other museum visitors as if they are not worthy of enjoying the same artwork I’m looking at, the way someone like Holden Caulfield would do. Then again who am I to understand Munch? I haven’t lost my mother at two or my sister at thirteen. Their memory hasn’t haunted me for years to come. Yet it connects with me when he says “sickness, insanity and death were the angels that surrounded my cradle and they have followed me throughout my life.”</p>
<p>I also know the feeling of a lover facing away from me as her hair extends to my heart (<em>Separation II</em>). I know the fusion and the intensity of <em>The Kiss</em>. I also saw brilliance through darkness as he did when he painted Eva Mudocci in <em>The Brooch</em>. If you just look at the corner of her mouth, you can see how much he loved her.</p>
<p>I’m sure you’ll enjoy it for entirely different set of reasons. Perhaps for his poetry that binds all his works or the intensity eminating from his female figures. In any case, it’s worth your time.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="th-of-may-2019">27th of May, 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>La Double Vie de Véronique</em> by Krzysztof Kieślowski. There are no shortage of reasons why you’d like this movie, but its poetry and the scene she sings <em>Van den Budenmayer: Concerto en mi mineur</em> by Zbigniew Preisner should be enough on their own.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="th-of-may-2019-1">24th of May, 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li>Beggarstaffs exhibition at Fitzwilliam. It is worth going for their earlier works alone. They are effortless and timeless. The later works involving architecture are also pleasing. Structures can be more expressive than us mortals.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="always">Always</h3>
<ul>
<li>I love you and I miss you.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="th-of-may-2019-2">18th of May, 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Motion</em> by Rone</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="th-of-may-2019-3">14th of May, 2019</h3>
<pre><code>Not so much of a recommendation,
but a little old fact
you'll either like
or hate.

People in my group
will
read _your_ name
for a decade.

There is a poster
of the paper

_my_ own.

On it,
there is an example:

<h3 id="th-of-may-2019-4">10th of May, 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Otto</em> by Woodkid</li>
<li><em>Einstein On the Beach: Knee Play 5</em> by The Philip Glass Ensemble. Here’s weird for you. This is from the only opera I want to see.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="th-of-may-2019-5">8th of May, 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li>I saw <em>Cloud Atlas</em> maybe four times (twice in the cinema for good measure) and I love the story—how can I not? It’s so intertwined and it features Cambridge. Moreover, it has one of the gentlest scores I know of. I’m fond of <em>Cloud Atlas Opening Title</em>, <em>Travel to Edinburgh</em>, <em>Kesselring</em>, and <em>Cloud Atlas End Title</em> in particular. I wonder if it is obvious to you which of those appeals to me the most.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="th-of-may-2019-6">6th of May, 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Sunny</em> by Bobby Hebb</p>
<p>I wanted today to do justice to the song, but to no avail. My celestial powers fell short. Luckily, you don’t lack imagination, so perhaps picture yourself in a serene summer’s day either chilling under the shade of a tree or having a coffee in a little Italian town.</p>
<p>I think a good birthday message is less about the wishes and more about celebrating the highlights of your past age. For me, this makes finding the source material a rather difficult task, so I’ll keep it short. It puts my <em>heart</em> at ease to know that you have achieved, in your words, a happy ending. My wish is that it trancends to a happy being.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="th-of-may-2019-7">4th of May, 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li>I think I favour Nina Simone’s <em>Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood</em> over <em>Feeling Good</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="th-of-april-2019">29th of April, 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li>Machin Feast at Queens’ on 10th of May. The deadline for applications is tomorrow 10pm. I hear there is good company.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="th-of-april-2019-1">28th of April, 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>A Dream within a Dream</em> by Oren Lavie. Have a peaceful Sunday darling.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="th-of-april-2019-2">27th of April, 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.thecut.com/2018/05/how-anna-delvey-tricked-new-york.html"><em>How Anna Delvey tricked New York</em></a> by Jessica Pressler. The writing is mediocre at best, but the story is silver and it is shined by its reality. It would be a delight if you lended your voice to a fictional Anna Delvey.</li>
<li>The natural follow up recommendation would be my favourite film in the whole world. I’ve already told you about it in person and you weren’t terribly interested, so maybe I should spare you. In any case, although you didn’t realise it at the time, my sharing of that film with anyone is deeply personal. I wouldn’t write it down anywhere—I realise as I write that, this is the polar opposite of what you’d do.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="th-of-april-2019-3">20th of April, 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Microhabitat</em> directed by Jeon Go-Woon. It’s an honest story. The protagonist presents an ideal without glorifying the cost of being true to yourself. She, dare I say it, reminds me of who you could be. If you watch the trailer, I promise the film offers more than that.</li>
</ul>
<p>PS. Do you like the commentary that goes with the recommendations?</p>
<h3 id="th-of-april-2019-4">14th of April, 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjhZhI2Zthg"><em>Can’t Stop Running</em></a> by Adam Ben Ezra. I love this one. You’ll love this one.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="th-of-april-2019-5">11th of April, 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Asturias</em> by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEfFbuT3I6A">Isaac Albeniz</a>. I’m sure you listened to it many times before, but I just realised how much the player influences the emotional outcome. Here’s the father of classical guitar <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCeebWgjrrU">Andres Segovia</a> playing it. He lacks Albeniz’s vigour but adds tranquility. Then there is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inBKFMB-yPg">Ana Vidovic</a> not so much playing distinct notes, but gliding from one to another.</li>
<li><em>The Song of the Golden Dragon</em> by Estas Tonne. A piece not to enjoy but to be overwhelmed.</li>
<li><em>Celestial Intoxication</em> by Shpongle. Maybe not the most skilfull, but to me the most interesting one. It covers the largest emotional ground. I’m sure you know when to listen to this one.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="th-of-april-2019-6">5th of April, 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Caprice</em> by Worakls. Not your genre, but it fits the first week of April rather well.</p>
<p>Like Thylacine, Worakls too names songs after places. I like the idea. I want to hear a good <em>Istanbul</em> and a <em>Marrakech</em>. It might take a while.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="st-of-march-2019">31st of March, 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><em>The Fall</em> directed by Tarsem Singh. I don’t know how it hasn’t occurred to me to suggest it to you until now. It’s dramatic just in the way you’d like and its visual aesthetic is just the way I like.</p>
The trailer on Youtube reveals too much though. So may be take a leap of faith?</li>
<li><em>Black Sands</em> by Bonobo</li>
<li><p><em>Champion Sound</em> by Crystal Fighters. This one is when you’re in a good mood. It’ll boost it, I promise. The whole album is interesting, the lyrics are not always uplifting, but the melodies are.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="th-of-march-2019">26th of March, 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Zima Blue</em> is the 9th episode of the short animation anthology on Netflix. It’s based on a short story written by Alastair Reynolds. I like the message of course, but I think you’d enjoy the narration more.</p>
A less pronounced message is that our reasoning and perception are noisy and often far from the reality. You can relate to that, can’t you?</li>
<li><em>Ayayay</em> by Tony Tonite</li>
<li><p>I found the perfect song to suggest to you on your birthday.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>PS. Honestly, I have a lot to say about your recent story, but not here. At least, I can say that I read it all with a genuine smile on my face.</p>
<h3 id="th-of-march-2019-1">24th of March, 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Aurora</em> by Zero 7</li>
<li><em>Curls</em> and <em>Petals</em> by Bibio</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="th-of-march-2019-2">15th of March, 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li>They don’t know what I know.</li>

<ul>
<li><p>I can hear the music today. It’s so gloomy outside, yet everything I see shines a bit brighter.</p>
<p>I can’t believe I haven’t recommended you any Four Tet songs so far. Maybe because I thought you’d find them <em>too</em> electronic. The problem with not seeing someone for a long time is that you start losing the provenance of impressions, which is the best bit of knowing anyone or anything, don’t you think?</p>
<p>Anyway, here are three: She Moves She, Locked, and Two Thousand and Seventeen. If I were to see these as an envelope produced by a single synthesiser and not as individual songs (and in a sense that is the case), they’d correspond to <em>attack</em>, <em>sustain</em>, and <em>release</em>. They work well in that order. It should really have <em>decay</em> between attack and sustain, but we have too much of that elsewhere.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="th-of-february-2019">29th of February, 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li>Le Roi et l’Oiseau (1980) directed by Paul Grimault. This is an animated movie that took more than 20 years to complete for various reasons. It is done in collaboration with the poet Jacques Prévert. More than a dozen times, the movie manages to invoke the sublime through its artwork. The interactions between its bizarre characters are captivating despite the simplicity of the plot. To me, it is one of the more tasteful surrealist works of cinema.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="th-of-february-2019-1">26th of February, 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li>It’s another sunny day and that calls for another song from the past. California Dreamin’ by The Mamas &amp; The Papas.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="th-of-february-2019-2">25th of February, 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li>Aquarius (Let the Sunshine in) by the 5th Dimension and Her Morning Elegance by Oren Lavie. I know you know them both, but they fit the day and you so well, wouldn’t you say?</li>
<li>Enjoy the sunshine.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="th-of-february-2019-3">17th of February, 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li>You mentioning poetry reminded me of Paterson (2016) by Jim Jarmusch. It is a slow-burning film about a poet. I told you this before, I cannot feel poetry unless it is in Turkish. Some recitations in this movie are exceptions to that. Jarmusch is also the director of Only Lovers Left Alive, Dead Man, and Coffee &amp; Cigarettes (more like the last short film that we liked and less like the others). Hopefully, that gives you an idea.</li>
<li>What I said about not talking about our lives is a good principle, but when you <em>need</em> me to be there for you, just tell me and I’ll listen.</li>
<li>It felt good.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="th-of-february-2019-4">13th of February, 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li>Before You <del>Love</del> Leave by Frenic, so that you can dance on your own.</li>
<li>Summon the Fire by The Comet is Coming. Just some good modern Jazz.</li>
<li>Finally, there’s a song by a good friend of mine. It has no lyrics, but the journey it takes you could not have been clearer if it was spelled out. I’d have liked you to listen to it, but I don’t know how.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rd-of-february-2019">3rd of February, 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li>Travel Alone by Dr. DAD. Not only it puts me at ease as I’m listening to it right now but also, just a moment ago, as I was still listening to it, I created something elegant. If I’m right, its effects will echo way beyond my PhD. From now on, at least in my mind and completely incidentally, everything that follows from it is going to be linked to this song.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/arts/music/stradivarius-sound-bank-recording-cremona.html">To Save the Sound of a Stradivarius, a Whole City Must Keep Quiet</a> by Max Paradiso. The decadence in this story is going to make you a bit uncomfortable, but it’d be difficult for you not to like it deep down.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="th-of-january-2019">19th of January, 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li>There is a new album of Thylacine called ROADS, Vol. 1. In nature, when a force is acted upon a body at its natural frequency, the body resonates with greater intensity. This describes nicely how this album makes me feel. You can start with El Alba.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="th-of-january-2019-1">15th of January, 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li>Persona (1966) by Ingmar Bergman. There is no doubt, you’ll love this film. They are showing it in the Picturehouse on Thursday. I know you’re not reading this, but I wish you did and… You should give him a go some time.</li>
<li>Winter Sleep by Bongbeck. As it happens, Winter Sleep is also the name of my favourite Nuri Bilge Ceylan film.</li>
<li>Maa’asalama by Traumer</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="st-of-december-2018">21st of December, 2018</h3>
<ul>
<li>We’re sufficiently close to the end of the year that I can announce Kingdoms in Colour by Maribou State as the best album of the year. You can start with Feel Good, then Kama, followed by Part Time Glory, but you should really listen to the whole thing. It’s a real treat.</li>
<li>Just in case you’re craving some electronic jazz blend, you can try Amateur Girlfriends Go Proskirt Agents by Xploding Plastix. I swear I haven’t noticed the ridiculous album and band names until now. Within the album Sports, Not Heavy Crime would be a good start.</li>
<li>Also, I trust you’re in warm company that pierces through the cold and dark days we are going through. Do enjoy the festive season.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rd-of-december-2018">3rd of December, 2018</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Bertolucci died two weeks after I recommended you the Sheltering Sky. Call me superstitious, but I’m sceptical about recommending you another one now. Yet, here I go. The Great Pear Tree by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. It’s about a fresh university graduand trying to publish his first book. He’s trapped by worldly problems such as family and money. He’s not exactly what you’d call a protagonist and his concerns are different to yours when it comes to writing. I still think you’d find it insightful.</p>
<p>Its director is my favourite Turkish one alive. His movies are beautiful and capture the Turkish human condition without any pretence. Maybe give it a try. I hesitate recommending him to anyone because his movies are slow-burning and long. I regret doing that with you. So here it is.</p>
I’m horrible at being subtle, ain’t I? This is the third movie about a writer I recommended to you. Allow me to be more direct, I hope you’re writing every day and I hope people get to hear your voice some day. It’d be a great crime otherwise.</li>
<li><p>Suspiria (2018) by Luca Guadagnino. This is the guy who directed Call Me by Your Name last year. It was beautiful and very unexpectedly turned into a great feminist statement. I know you can’t stand gore, but if you can stomach it for once, let it be for Suspiria. If this is not enough of a pitch, Tilda Swinton is in it and she reigns supreme as she always does. It’s screening at the Picturehouse right now and the big screen only renders it more beautiful.</p>
In case you decide, you can’t (won’t) stomach it, then at least watch the predecessor to Call Me by Your Name, I am Love. Swinton is leading and you’ll identify with her character perfectly.</li>
<li><p>I don’t think you’d like Haruki Murakami. He’s focused too much on unpacking the individual and deals with solitude and isolation and alienation like Kafka but with a different tone. But there is one undeniable benefit of reading him and that is his past self. He ran a Jazz bar in Tokyo for many years you see. So he sprinkles his pages with great Jazz albums, real treats. One such album is Curtis Fuller’s Blues-Ette, in particular Five Spot After Dark.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="th-of-november-2018">14th of November, 2018</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The Sheltering Sky directed by Bernardo Bertolucci.</p>
Cinematographically, it may be one of the most pleasing films I’ve ever seen. I think you’d enjoy the serenity of Africa as much as I did. Yet, way more than the images, you’ll enjoy the characters (played by Debra Winger and John Malkovich) and their rather impossible situation. It is the kind of film that makes you read the book. It also has one of my favourite passages in a film; I’m sure you can figure out which. If this is not good enough sales pitch, its soundtrack is composed by Ryuichi Sakamato and the corresponding soundtrack album is a masterpiece on its own right.</li>
<li>Becoming by Mammal Hands</li>
<li><p>Vous Dansez by KZA</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="th-of-november-2018-1">6th of November, 2018</h3>
<ul>
<li>Twenty-Four Hours in the Life of a Woman by Stefan Zweig. I don’t remember any other story I’ve read with more vivid imagery.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="th-of-october-2018">29th of October, 2018</h3>
<ul>
<li>Yazz Ahmed concert in Cambridge Jazz Festival on the 18th of November</li>
<li>Klimt/Schiele exhibition in Royal Academy or Arts from November 4th</li>
<li>Thylacine’s new single called “The Road”</li>
<li>“Stranger than Fiction” is a precursor to “Dans la Maison”. It is magical realism which is not your cup of tea, I know, but still worth seeing.</li>

<h1>Für Rebecca</h1>


<p class="in-which">In which I provide a not-so-awkward recommendation service for her.</p>

<ul>
<li>I imagine if you read Homer’s <em>Odyssey</em>, you hated it as much as I loved it.
I won’t make the case for it as Margaret Atwood ruined it for me too in her
novella <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Penelopiad"><em>The Penelopiad</em></a>.
She retells the famous story from the perspective of Odysseus’ wife pointing
out the gross injustices with a whimsical language. I bet you’d enjoy it as
much as I did. Her voice reminded me of you.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="th-of-july-2021">16th of July, 2021</h3>
<p>Not all interludes last five minutes.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>La Tortue Rouge</em> (2021). It is poetry but in the form of animation. It
would appeal to you.</li>
</ul>

Prestige</em></a>
by Charles King. Not the greatest piece of writing or the content, but some
interesting insights about our nature and our surroundings.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="th-of-july-2019-1">10th of July, 2019</h3>
<p>I apologise for the morbidity and the repetition in advance,</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Soon after we met, I finished Borges’ stories and essays. Then came a
one-page parable called <em>The Witness</em>. That along with our conversation
triggered a number of thoughts, connections, and (re)recommendations.</p>
<p>The parable is about death and precisely the death of events and ideas that
are witnessed by the recently deceased. I was astonished how close that was
to what we talked about, people living as an image in others’ minds and how
true death follows long after that of the body.</p></li>
<li><p>Borges does not take it as far as I did though, his parable kills things
with the last person who witnessed them directly while I allow them to get
evolved, deformed, and passed through generations and distances far from
their originator.</p>
<p>I’d like to think that my mind went further than that of Borges, but the
truth is it didn’t. The idea is mainly derived from <em>I Am A Strange Loop</em> by
Douglas Hofstadter. This is the book that made me stop eat meat. He is
mathematically minded, but also emotionally elevated like Borges. The second
chapter is titled <em>On Souls and Their Sizes</em>, which starts with the section
<em>Soul-Shards</em>. You know I like analogies but the concept of a soul-shard is
etched into my brain the moment I laid eyes on it. The chapter talks about
his relationship with his wife who passed away and how an unfaithful copy of
her (shards of her soul) lives in him and influences his actions, so in a
way she keeps living. He admits the probability of a grieving man coming up
with a theory of consciousness that gives him some solace, but I buy it.</p></li>
<li><p>This brings me to the final scene of <em>The Sheltering Sky</em> (and the ending of
the book of the same title which I have not read) directed by Bernardo
Bertolucci. An old man says the following passage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because we don’t know when we will die, we get to think of life as an
inexhaustible well. Yet everything happens only a certain number of times,
and a very small number really. How many more times will you remember a
certain afternoon of your childhood, some afternoon that is so deeply a
part of your being that you can’t even conceive of your life without it?
Perhaps four or five times more, perhaps not even that. How many more
times will you watch the full moon rise? Perhaps twenty. And yet it all
seems limitless.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I feel the urge to recite this passage in my head from time to time. I
haven’t always behaved this way and that’s a loss, but for some time now
(even before I knew you) I’ve been making mental notes of things that
matters. That is why I waited for your bus to leave at Parker’s Piece and
watched you quietly. It’s also why on that special Saturday as I looked at
you, you had all my attention, all my mental might trying to save every
second of the day, especially when you were quietly immersed into my
friend’s music. All so that I can remember it faithfully for finite number
of times.</p></li>
<li><p>Ryuichi Sakamato who scored the soundtracks for <em>The Sheltering Sky</em> was
similarly moved by that passage. That’s why many years after scoring the
movie, he recorded <em>fullmoon</em> which has the passage read in many languages.
He overlays these recordings with ambient music in the background to create
a touching piece.</p></li>
<li><p>He discusses this and his general approach to music in the documentary
<em>Ryuichi Sakamoto: Coda</em>. He has a kind soul and the documentary is one of
the best I’ve ever seen. Mainly because I believe in the honesty of what is
on the screen. It shows him deal with cancer and his spiritual devotion to
his work. It tells the story of the damaged piano rescued from the tsunami
in Japan and the concert he gave with it and why. It is a worthy portrait to
see.</p>
<p>In a way, he is similar to <em>Hayao Miyazaki</em>. Maybe there is something unique
in Japan’s culture that bestows kind people with a wisdom that is not
paralleled elsewhere in the world. Maybe I’ll have to learn to be kinder and
go there to see for myself.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>That’s all for now. Lights are out, music is over.</p>
<p>PS. I decided to curb my wings further and actively avoid looking at the
analytics for this page. I don’t want you changing your habits because I might
see it.</p>
<h3 id="th-of-july-2019-2">5th of July, 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Cardinals</em>, <em>Hair</em>, <em>The Knowledge</em>, <em>Later</em> and <em>I Walk Away</em> by
Lele Marchitelli. Apparently, she is the new go-to person of <em>Paolo
Sorrentino</em>, the director of two of my favourite films, <em>La Grande Bellezza</em>
and <em>Youth</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>The first four of those songs are from the soundtrack album of <em>The Young
Pope</em>. I’ve only seen the first episode, but so far it is everything we
would like. It is stylish, decadent, and clever both in writing, acting, and
cinematography.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rd-of-july-2019">3rd of July, 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><em>La Joya</em> and <em>Reframe</em> by Aukai. The whole album, <em>Reminiscence</em>, is nice
and mellow like a summer day spent on a hammock with the exception of
<em>Reframe</em>. That sounds more like a love affair.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a small village in Turkey where a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistled_language">whistled
language</a> is, well,
whistled. The village is named Kuşköy which literally means the village of
birds. Here’s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQmF7kbOrmE">video</a>
explaining the whole affair. It is very unreasonable of me, but I want to go
and learn their dialect.</p>
<p>Where I stand, it sounds like a thinning of spoken languages and I find it
fitting that it is more musical. Songs too communicate way more than their
lyrics alone, don’t they? So maybe if we thin the whistled language further,
we may communicate with silence.</p></li>
<li><p>Also if you look at the entry for <a href="#th-of-february-2019-3">17th of February,
2019</a>, you will see my recommendation for
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8pGJBgiiDU"><em>Paterson</em></a>, the movie I
mentioned about the bus driver poet.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="th-of-june-2019">29th of June, 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li>It was nice running into you today.</li>
<li><em>The Cell</em> by David Allred. It is contemporary folk apparently.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="st-of-june-2019">21st of June, 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Spanish Caravan</em> by The Doors.</p>
<p><em>Carry me Caraban take me away~~ Take me to
Portugal, take me to Spain~~ Andalusia with fields full of grain~~ I have to
see you again and again~~</em></p></li>
<li><p>I’m off to Phoenix and then to LA, so no posts until next week. Enjoy the
sun for me, would you?</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="th-of-june-2019-1">19th of June, 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>On multiple occasions, you asked me if I resented you. You were so far off
the mark every time. However, about five or six months ago I did come close.</p>
<p>I was idly browsing titles in Waterstones and in a stroke of luck, <em>A Room
of One’s Own</em> caught my eye. I thought what a funny curious title it had. At
that point, I was still of the opinion that Virginia Woolf owes her fame to
being a feminist. How wrong I was. I don’t think I know anyone whose use of
language and conviction are as captivating. Thinking that it was possible
(even probable) that I would have ignored her for the rest of my life out of
ignorance is terrifying. What a waste it would have been.</p>
<p>The reason I almost resented you is, out of everyone I know, you were the
person who should have picked up a copy of the book, smack me in the head
with it, and tell me to read it. I’d have read it and I’d have been
grateful. Having known you, my introduction to Woolf shouldn’t have been by
chance (though I’m sure subconsciously you’re partly the reason I bought <em>A
Room of One’s Own</em> that day).</p>
<p>When you told me you were going to teach and that you are sick of being
poor, six months ago I would have objected vehemently (not that you should
care) from the top of my high horse. However, as I read your message the
first thing that appeared in my mind was that everyone needs a room of their
own and £500 a year (adjusted for inflation since Woolf’s time). My opinion
now (in part thanks to Woolf) is that maybe once you can breathe freely, you
can make your voice heard louder. Maybe that is all you need.</p>
<p>This brings me to the other title I finished reading last week, <em>The Death
of the Moth and Other Essays</em>. I’m weary of suggesting you a Woolf title, of
course. It’s dangerously close to mansplaining, but it seems this collection
of essays is seldom found in bookshops and discussed even less. They have
been posthumously published by her husband.</p>
<p>Half the essays are about great men of letters. I don’t think you’d like
those. They wouldn’t bring tears to your eyes as reading Schopenhauer once
did, but I don’t see you taking joy in reading them either. The other essays
are, however, way more fascinating. In particular, the titular essay <em>The
Death of the Moth</em> is maybe the peak of modernism. She writes about the last
hours of a moth that she watched as it tried to escape through the window,
but couldn’t due to the glass blocking the way. In a subject seemingly dull,
she fully describes life with eloquence. Joyce’s quote “in the particular
lies the universal” fully captures this essay. A close second in the
collection is <em>Street Haunting</em> which describes her wandering in the streets
of London at night. It is a wonderful journey and I think it will speak to
you. It is the kind of wondering that would render you joyous. Then there
is <em>Middlebrow</em> and <em>Professions for Women</em>, in which fire comes out of
pages unapologetically. I don’t think the latter essay will be useful to you
because you have already killed your angel, but it is still enjoyable to
read her go at it. Finally, there are <em>Why?</em>, <em>Craftsmanship</em> and <em>A Letter
to a Young Poet</em>. As I’m sure you can tell, these are all about writing and
language. They may or may not have utility for you, I can’t judge. However,
I do think you’d enjoy reading them regardless just as I enjoy reading a
well-written essay on mathematics even when the content is second nature.</p></li>
<li><p>On other news, my move is now complete. The room speaks to me. As if all
these years it was calling for me. Now with my arrival, I feel the space
around me is in unison with my actions. The perfect place to write a book,
which is fortunate because that is my task for the next three months.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="th-of-june-2019-2">16th of June, 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Ballata dell’amore cieco</em> by Fabrizio de André</li>
<li>Good luck with the move this week. You helping me with my last move was pure
and very kind. I appreciate it. I hope everything goes smoothly.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="th-of-june-2019-3">14th of June, 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Plaisirs d’amour</em> by René Aubry. That’s the album we listened to in that
bay I sent you the photos of. What is not captured in pictures can be heard
in the melody. Maybe start with <em>Salento</em>, <em>Scirocco</em>, and <em>Sirtaki à
Helsinki</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="nd-of-june-2019">2nd of June, 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>I don’t know if you have any idea why I maintain this page. I personally
have eight reasons on odd days and more on even days and today is an even
day. I’ll give you one.</p>
<p>If I were a fire, the entries on this page would be the little cracking bits
that leave the main body of the fire. Not because they want to, but because
they have to. They are the bits that could not be contained. But a little
cracking bit of the fire is not the fire, merely a fraction of a
fraction of a fraction.</p>
<p>The reason I’m telling this right now is I won’t have an Internet connection
next week. I’ll be up in the mountains and down by the bays and back up
again, walking. An eroding unfaithful copy of your self that is in my mind
will be there too (without the hassle of walking of course). Without a
doubt, I’ll see a bird, or a rock, or the glorious sea curving just right.
It too will be a little bit of fire that I’d like you to feel, but I can’t
make you feel. If I could share them, I would, but you can’t truly share a
moment in a different moment, can you?</p>
<p>What I’m trying to say is I wish you could see through my eyes and think my
thoughts.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Daydream</em> by Wallace Collection</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="st-of-june-2019-1">1st of June, 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Edvard Munch: love and angst</em> exhibition in British Museum. I attempted
writing this entry and failed. I find it surprisingly difficult to be honest
and if I’m not being honest, what’s the point?</p>
<p>I desperately want to say I understand how Munch feels and that his soul
through his work resonates with me. I look at the other museum visitors as
if they are not worthy of enjoying the same artwork I’m looking at, the way
someone like Holden Caulfield would do. Then again who am I to understand
Munch? I haven’t lost my mother at two or my sister at thirteen. Their
memory hasn’t haunted me for years to come. Yet it connects with me when
he says “sickness, insanity and death were the angels that surrounded my
cradle and they have followed me throughout my life.”</p>
<p>I also know the feeling of a lover facing away from me as her hair extends
to my heart (<em>Separation II</em>). I know the fusion and the intensity of <em>The
Kiss</em>. I also saw brilliance through darkness as he did when he painted Eva
Mudocci in <em>The Brooch</em>. If you just look at the corner of her mouth, you
can see how much he loved her.</p>
<p>I’m sure you’ll enjoy it for entirely different set of reasons. Perhaps for
his poetry that binds all his works or the intensity eminating from his
female figures. In any case, it’s worth your time.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="th-of-may-2019">27th of May, 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>La Double Vie de Véronique</em> by Krzysztof Kieślowski. There are no shortage
of reasons why you’d like this movie, but its poetry and the scene she sings
<em>Van den Budenmayer: Concerto en mi mineur</em> by Zbigniew Preisner should be
enough on their own.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="th-of-may-2019-1">24th of May, 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li>Beggarstaffs exhibition at Fitzwilliam. It is worth going for their earlier
works alone. They are effortless and timeless. The later works involving
architecture are also pleasing. Structures can be more expressive than
us mortals.</li>

<li>I saw <em>Cloud Atlas</em> maybe four times (twice in the cinema for good measure)
and I love the story—how can I not? It’s so intertwined and it features
Cambridge. Moreover, it has one of the gentlest scores I know of. I’m fond
of <em>Cloud Atlas Opening Title</em>, <em>Travel to Edinburgh</em>, <em>Kesselring</em>, and
<em>Cloud Atlas End Title</em> in particular. I wonder if it is obvious to you
which of those appeals to me the most.</li>

<li><p><em>Sunny</em> by Bobby Hebb</p>
<p>I wanted today to do justice to the song, but to no avail. My celestial
powers fell short. Luckily, you don’t lack imagination, so perhaps picture
yourself in a serene summer’s day either chilling under the shade of a tree
or having a coffee in a little Italian town.</p>
<p>I think a good birthday message is less about the wishes and more about
celebrating the highlights of your past age. For me, this makes finding the
source material a rather difficult task, so I’ll keep it short. It puts my
<em>heart</em> at ease to know that you have achieved, in your words, a happy
ending. My wish is that it trancends to a happy being.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://www.thecut.com/2018/05/how-anna-delvey-tricked-new-york.html"><em>How Anna Delvey tricked New
York</em></a>
by Jessica Pressler. The writing is mediocre at best, but the story is
silver and it is shined by its reality. It would be a delight if you lended
your voice to a fictional Anna Delvey.</li>
<li>The natural follow up recommendation would be my favourite film in the whole
world. I’ve already told you about it in person and you weren’t terribly
interested, so maybe I should spare you. In any case, although you didn’t
realise it at the time, my sharing of that film with anyone is deeply
personal. I wouldn’t write it down anywhere—I realise as I write that,
this is the polar opposite of what you’d do.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="th-of-april-2019-3">20th of April, 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Microhabitat</em> directed by Jeon Go-Woon. It’s an honest story. The
protagonist presents an ideal without glorifying the cost of being true to
yourself. She, dare I say it, reminds me of who you could be. If you watch
the trailer, I promise the film offers more than that.</li>

<ul>
<li><em>Asturias</em> by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEfFbuT3I6A">Isaac Albeniz</a>.
I’m sure you listened to it many times before, but I just realised how much
the player influences the emotional outcome. Here’s the father of classical
guitar <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCeebWgjrrU">Andres Segovia</a> playing
it. He lacks Albeniz’s vigour but adds tranquility. Then there is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inBKFMB-yPg">Ana
Vidovic</a> not so much playing
distinct notes, but gliding from one to another.</li>
<li><em>The Song of the Golden Dragon</em> by Estas Tonne. A piece not to enjoy but to
be overwhelmed.</li>
<li><em>Celestial Intoxication</em> by Shpongle. Maybe not the most skilfull, but to me
the most interesting one. It covers the largest emotional ground. I’m sure
you know when to listen to this one.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="th-of-april-2019-6">5th of April, 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Caprice</em> by Worakls. Not your genre, but it fits the first week of April
rather well.</p>
<p>Like Thylacine, Worakls too names songs after places. I like the idea. I
want to hear a good <em>Istanbul</em> and a <em>Marrakech</em>. It might take a while.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="st-of-march-2019">31st of March, 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><em>The Fall</em> directed by Tarsem Singh. I don’t know how it hasn’t occurred to
me to suggest it to you until now. It’s dramatic just in the way you’d like
and its visual aesthetic is just the way I like.</p>
<p>The trailer on Youtube reveals too much though. So may be take a leap of
faith?</p></li>
<li><p><em>Black Sands</em> by Bonobo</p></li>
<li><p><em>Champion Sound</em> by Crystal Fighters. This one is when you’re in a good
mood. It’ll boost it, I promise. The whole album is interesting, the lyrics
are not always uplifting, but the melodies are.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="th-of-march-2019">26th of March, 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Zima Blue</em> is the 9th episode of the short animation anthology on Netflix.
It’s based on a short story written by Alastair Reynolds. I like the message
of course, but I think you’d enjoy the narration more.</p>
<p>A less pronounced message is that our reasoning and perception are noisy and
often far from the reality. You can relate to that, can’t you?</p></li>

<li><p>I can hear the music today. It’s so gloomy outside, yet everything I see
shines a bit brighter.</p>
<p>I can’t believe I haven’t recommended you any Four Tet songs so far. Maybe
because I thought you’d find them <em>too</em> electronic. The problem with not
seeing someone for a long time is that you start losing the provenance of
impressions, which is the best bit of knowing anyone or anything, don’t you
think?</p>
<p>Anyway, here are three: She Moves She, Locked, and Two Thousand and
Seventeen. If I were to see these as an envelope produced by a single
synthesiser and not as individual songs (and in a sense that is the case),
they’d correspond to <em>attack</em>, <em>sustain</em>, and <em>release</em>. They work well in
that order. It should really have <em>decay</em> between attack and sustain, but we
have too much of that elsewhere.</p></li>

<li>Le Roi et l’Oiseau (1980) directed by Paul Grimault. This is an animated
movie that took more than 20 years to complete for various reasons. It is
done in collaboration with the poet Jacques Prévert. More than a dozen
times, the movie manages to invoke the sublime through its artwork. The
interactions between its bizarre characters are captivating despite the
simplicity of the plot. To me, it is one of the more tasteful surrealist
works of cinema.</li>

<li>You mentioning poetry reminded me of
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8pGJBgiiDU">Paterson</a> (2016) by Jim
Jarmusch. It is a slow-burning film about a poet. I told you this before, I
cannot feel poetry unless it is in Turkish. Some recitations in this movie
are exceptions to that. Jarmusch is also the director of Only Lovers Left
Alive, Dead Man, and Coffee &amp; Cigarettes (more like the last short film that
we liked and less like the others). Hopefully, that gives you an idea.</li>
<li>What I said about not talking about our lives is a good principle, but when
you <em>need</em> me to be there for you, just tell me and I’ll listen.</li>
<li>It felt good.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="th-of-february-2019-4">13th of February, 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li>Before You <del>Love</del> Leave by Frenic, so that you can dance on your own.</li>
<li>Summon the Fire by The Comet is Coming. Just some good modern Jazz.</li>
<li>Finally, there’s a song by a good friend of mine. It has no lyrics, but the
journey it takes you could not have been clearer if it was spelled out. I’d
have liked you to listen to it, but I don’t know how.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rd-of-february-2019">3rd of February, 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li>Travel Alone by Dr. DAD. Not only it puts me at ease as I’m listening to it
right now but also, just a moment ago, as I was still listening to it, I
created something elegant. If I’m right, its effects will echo way beyond my
PhD. From now on, at least in my mind and completely incidentally,
everything that follows from it is going to be linked to this song.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/arts/music/stradivarius-sound-bank-recording-cremona.html">To Save the Sound of a Stradivarius, a Whole City Must Keep
Quiet</a>
by Max Paradiso. The decadence in this story is going to make you a bit
uncomfortable, but it’d be difficult for you not to like it deep down.</li>

<li>There is a new album of Thylacine called ROADS, Vol. 1. In nature, when a
force is acted upon a body at its natural frequency, the body resonates with
greater intensity. This describes nicely how this album makes me feel. You
can start with El Alba.</li>

<li>Persona (1966) by Ingmar Bergman. There is no doubt, you’ll love this film.
They are showing it in the Picturehouse on Thursday. I know you’re not
reading this, but I wish you did and… You should give him a go some time.</li>
<li>Winter Sleep by Bongbeck. As it happens, Winter Sleep is also the name of my
favourite Nuri Bilge Ceylan film.</li>
<li>Maa’asalama by Traumer</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="st-of-december-2018">21st of December, 2018</h3>
<ul>
<li>We’re sufficiently close to the end of the year that I can announce Kingdoms
in Colour by Maribou State as the best album of the year. You can start with
Feel Good, then Kama, followed by Part Time Glory, but you should really
listen to the whole thing. It’s a real treat.</li>
<li>Just in case you’re craving some electronic jazz blend, you can try Amateur
Girlfriends Go Proskirt Agents by Xploding Plastix. I swear I haven’t
noticed the ridiculous album and band names until now. Within the album
Sports, Not Heavy Crime would be a good start.</li>
<li>Also, I trust you’re in warm company that pierces through the cold and dark
days we are going through. Do enjoy the festive season.</li>

<li><p>Bertolucci died two weeks after I recommended you the Sheltering Sky. Call
me superstitious, but I’m sceptical about recommending you another one now.
Yet, here I go. The Great Pear Tree by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. It’s about a fresh
university graduand trying to publish his first book. He’s trapped by
worldly problems such as family and money. He’s not exactly what you’d call
a protagonist and his concerns are different to yours when it comes to
writing. I still think you’d find it insightful.</p>
<p>Its director is my favourite Turkish one alive. His movies are beautiful and
capture the Turkish human condition without any pretence. Maybe give it a
try. I hesitate recommending him to anyone because his movies are
slow-burning and long. I regret doing that with you. So here it is.</p>
<p>I’m horrible at being subtle, ain’t I? This is the third movie about a
writer I recommended to you. Allow me to be more direct, I hope you’re
writing every day and I hope people get to hear your voice some day. It’d be
a great crime otherwise.</p></li>
<li><p>Suspiria (2018) by Luca Guadagnino. This is the guy who directed Call Me by
Your Name last year. It was beautiful and very unexpectedly turned into a
great feminist statement. I know you can’t stand gore, but if you can
stomach it for once, let it be for Suspiria. If this is not enough of a
pitch, Tilda Swinton is in it and she reigns supreme as she always does.
It’s screening at the Picturehouse right now and the big screen only renders
it more beautiful.</p>
<p>In case you decide, you can’t (won’t) stomach it, then at least watch the
predecessor to Call Me by Your Name, I am Love. Swinton is leading and
you’ll identify with her character perfectly.</p></li>
<li><p>I don’t think you’d like Haruki Murakami. He’s focused too much on unpacking
the individual and deals with solitude and isolation and alienation like
Kafka but with a different tone. But there is one undeniable benefit of
reading him and that is his past self. He ran a Jazz bar in Tokyo for many
years you see. So he sprinkles his pages with great Jazz albums, real
treats. One such album is Curtis Fuller’s Blues-Ette, in particular Five
Spot After Dark.</p></li>

<h3 id="th-of-november-2018">14th of November, 2018</h3>

<li><p>The Sheltering Sky directed by Bernardo Bertolucci.</p>
<p>Cinematographically, it may be one of the most pleasing films I’ve ever
seen. I think you’d enjoy the serenity of Africa as much as I did. Yet, way
more than the images, you’ll enjoy the characters (played by Debra Winger
and John Malkovich) and their rather impossible situation. It is the kind of
film that makes you read the book. It also has one of my favourite passages
in a film; I’m sure you can figure out which. If this is not good enough
sales pitch, its soundtrack is composed by Ryuichi Sakamato and the
corresponding soundtrack album is a masterpiece on its own right.</p></li>

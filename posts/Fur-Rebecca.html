<h1>Für Rebecca</h1>


<p class="in-which">In which I provide a not-so-awkward recommendation service for her.</p>


<div class="post"><h3 id="st-of-december-2018">21st of December, 2018</h3>
<ul>
<li>We’re sufficiently close to the end of the year that I can announce Kingdoms in Colour by Maribou State as the best album of the year. You can start with Feel Good, then Kama, followed by Part Time Glory, but you should really listen to the whole thing. It’s a real treat.</li>
<li>Just in case you’re craving some electronic jazz blend, you can try Amateur Girlfriends Go Proskirt Agents by Xploding Plastix. I swear I haven’t noticed the ridiculous album and band names until now. Within the album Sports, Not Heavy Crime would be a good start.</li>
<li>Also, I trust you’re in warm company that pierces through the cold and dark days we are going through. Do enjoy the festive season.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rd-of-december-2018">3rd of December, 2018</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Bertolucci died two weeks after I recommended you the Sheltering Sky. Call me superstitious, but I’m sceptical about recommending you another one now. Yet, here I go. The Great Pear Tree by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. It’s about a fresh university graduand trying to publish his first book. He’s trapped by worldly problems such as family and money. He’s not exactly what you’d call a protagonist and his concerns are different to yours when it comes to writing. I still think you’d find it insightful.</p>
<p>Its director is my favourite Turkish one alive. His movies are beautiful and capture the Turkish human condition without any pretence. Maybe give it a try. I hesitate recommending him to anyone because his movies are slow-burning and long. I regret doing that with you. So here it is.</p>
I’m horrible at being subtle, ain’t I? This is the third movie about a writer I recommended to you. Allow me to be more direct, I hope you’re writing every day and I hope people get to hear your voice some day. It’d be a great crime otherwise.</li>
<li><p>Suspiria (2018) by Luca Guadagnino. This is the guy who directed Call Me by Your Name last year. It was beautiful and very unexpectedly turned into a great feminist statement. I know you can’t stand gore, but if you can stomach it for once, let it be for Suspiria. If this is not enough of a pitch, Tilda Swinton is in it and she reigns supreme as she always does. It’s screening at the Picturehouse right now and the big screen only renders it more beautiful.</p>
In case you decide, you can’t (won’t) stomach it, then at least watch the predecessor to Call Me by Your Name, I am Love. Swinton is leading and you’ll identify with her character perfectly.</li>
<li><p>I don’t think you’d like Haruki Murakami. He’s focused too much on unpacking the individual and deals with solitude and isolation and alienation like Kafka but with a different tone. But there is one undeniable benefit of reading him and that is his past self. He ran a Jazz bar in Tokyo for many years you see. So he sprinkles his pages with great Jazz albums, real treats. One such album is Curtis Fuller’s Blues-Ette, in particular Five Spot After Dark.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="th-of-november-2018">14th of November, 2018</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The Sheltering Sky directed by Bernardo Bertolucci.</p>
Cinematographically, it may be one of the most pleasing films I’ve ever seen. I think you’d enjoy the serenity of Africa as much as I did. Yet, way more than the images, you’ll enjoy the characters (played by Debra Winger and John Malkovich) and their rather impossible situation. It is the kind of film that makes you read the book. It also has one of my favourite passages in a film; I’m sure you can figure out which. If this is not good enough sales pitch, its soundtrack is composed by Ryuichi Sakamato and the corresponding soundtrack album is a masterpiece on its own right.</li>
<li>Becoming by Mammal Hands</li>
<li><p>Vous Dansez by KZA</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="th-of-november-2018-1">6th of November, 2018</h3>
<ul>
<li>Twenty-Four Hours in the Life of a Woman by Stefan Zweig. I don’t remember any other story I’ve read with more vivid imagery.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="th-of-october-2018">29th of October, 2018</h3>
<ul>
<li>Yazz Ahmed concert in Cambridge Jazz Festival on the 18th of November</li>
<li>Klimt/Schiele exhibition in Royal Academy or Arts from November 4th</li>
<li>Thylacine’s new single called “The Road”</li>
<li>“Stranger than Fiction” is a precursor to “Dans la Maison”. It is magical realism which is not your cup of tea, I know, but still worth seeing.</li>

  This is Mistral Contrastin's personal website. I am a computer science Ph.D.
  student at the University of Cambridge. Here you can find some information
  about my research, teaching as well as technical and cultural rumblings.
</p>

<p>
  My research is in programming languages and verification. I worked on static
  analysis of Fortran using Haskell. I am now working on a Datalog
  variant for querying temporal data. I am also an ex-Rubyist,
  an up-and-coming Haskeller, and a wannabe Agda programmer.
</p>

<p>
  I love fine arts of various sorts and working towards being a film buff. I do
  film photography and am learning to play <a

  reading papers in a caf&eacute;, I'm probably running mid-distance along the
  river Cam.

  I have a <a href="https://twitter.com/madgen_">Twitter account</a> and I
  prefer mentions over emails, but if you have to, try

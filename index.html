  This is Mistral Contrastin's personal website. I am a Ph.D. student at the
  Department of Computer Science and Technology, the University of Cambridge.
  Here you can find some information about my research, teaching as well as
  technical and cultural rumblings.
</p>

<p>
  My research is in programming languages and verification. I worked on static
  analysis of Fortran (chill, using Haskell). I am now working on a Datalog
  variant for querying data under version control. Also I am an ex-Rubyist,
  up-and-coming Haskeller, and wannabe Agda programmer.

<p>
  If I am not hacking in the nearest hip caf&eacute; or chasing the hottest art
  films I barely understand, I can be found running mid-distance by the River
  Cam.

  I have a <a href="https://twitter.com/madgen_">Twitter account</a> and I
  prefer mentions over emails.

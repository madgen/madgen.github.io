  This is Mistral Contrastin's personal website. I am a Ph.D. student at
  Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Cambridge. Here
  you can find some information about my research, teaching as well as technical
  and cultural rumblings.
</p>

<p>
  My research is in programming languages and verification. I worked on static
  analysis of Fortran (chill, using Haskell). I am now working on a Datalog
  variant for querying data under version control. Also I am an ex-Rubyist,
  up-and-coming Haskeller, and wannabe Agda programmer.

<p>
  If I am not in front of my computer in the nearest hip caf&eacute; or chasing
  the hottest art films that I barely understand, I can be found running mid
  distance by the River Cam.

# Teaching

I regularly supervise undergraduates at Cambridge for variety of courses.

You can also contact me if you want need a Part II supervisor for your project.
I will be interested in supervising projects related to verification, compilers,
version control systems, or computer viruses. Note that I will require you to
read the Pink Book over the summer and "Writing for Computer Science" by Justin
Sobel over Micahelmas.

# Teaching

I sporadically supervise undergraduates at Cambridge for a variety of courses.

You can also contact me if you want need a Part II supervisor for your project.
I will be interested in supervising projects related to verification, compilers,
type systems, and model checking. Note that I will require you to read the Pink
Book over the summer and "Writing for Computer Science" by Justin Sobel over
Michaelmas.
